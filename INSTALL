Installation instructions for the Strich Labs VGA Shield Library
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Inside the Arduino IDE, open Preferences and find your Sketchbook Location.
2. Create a directory called "Libraries" in your Sketchbook location, if it does not already exist.
3. Copy this entire folder as-is into the Libraries folder created in Step 2.
4. Download the MultiSerial library (which is a dependency for the VGA Shield) from https://github.com/StrichLabs/MultiSerial/archives/master and install it by copying the entire folder, the same as in Step 3.
5. Restart the Arduino IDE if it was running.
6. When you launch the Arduino IDE, use Sketch->Import Library->MultiSerial to begin using the library.
